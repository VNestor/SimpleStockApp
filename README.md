# Victor Nestor 4900 Project - Simple Financial Stock App 
## About
I am a recent graduate from Brooklyn College, and this is my senior project for my 4900 class.
I chose to make a simple stock market application, but didn't know where to begin. After extensive research,
I chose to build a web application using React. I started this project knowing nothing about React and some Javascript,
but I quickly learned the React library had everything I needed to achieve what I wanted to do. I wanted
to create a simple web app that can be used to quickly retrieve financial data a person would be interested in.
I have learned a lot, learning more about React, Javascript, and the resources and tools available.
